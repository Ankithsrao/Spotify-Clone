# Spotify-Clone
The Spotify Clone is a feature-rich, music streaming application inspired by the popular Spotify platform. This project simulates key functionalities, including user authentication, music browsing, playlist creation, and real-time audio streaming. Designed with a modern user interface, it provides a seamless user experience across desktop and mobile devices.
Built with a robust tech stack, the project utilizes [frontend framework, e.g., React/Next.js], [backend framework, e.g., Node.js/Django], and [database, e.g., PostgreSQL/Firebase] to deliver a scalable and efficient solution. Additional features include a music player with play, pause, and skip controls, as well as the ability to save favorite tracks and explore curated playlists.

This project demonstrates expertise in full-stack development, API integration, and the implementation of responsive, interactive user interfaces.
